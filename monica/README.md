======
Monica is a freshman CS major.  We've started off with me helping her with her project in C++

Session 1
----------
* We went over the basics of object-oriented programming
* Discussed the proper usage of header files in doing OOP
* We went over the structure of her project
* We went over the existing code for the Time object
* We created the function declarations for the Date object
* We implemented the Date object
* We created a main function to test that the Date object worked right
* We talked about what we'd need to do for the MArecord class
* We decided she would clean up and comment the code we made already, implement the MArecord class, and we'd meet the next day to go over what she did and make the MAlog class and the real main function

Monica
======
Monica is a freshman CS major.  We've started off with me helping her with her project in C++

Session 1
----------
* We went over the basics of object-oriented programming
* Discussed the proper usage of header files in doing OOP
* We went over the structure of her project
* We went over the existing code for the Time object
* We created the function declarations for the Date object
* We implemented the Date object
* We created a main function to test that the Date object worked right
* We talked about what we'd need to do for the MArecord class
* We decided she would clean up and comment the code we made already, implement the MArecord class, and we'd meet the next day to go over what she did and make the MAlog class and the real main function

Session 2
----------
* We started off by writing some stuff in her main function to test if what we did yesterday worked.  Apparently we didn't do everything right, so we worked through the errors.
* We fixed the comparison functions of Date (they weren't supposed to be const)
* We wrote the input and output operators for MArecord
* We wrote everything for MAlog, and I think we have everything done for the input function using the stringstream library.
* Tomorrow, we need to test that MAlog is working correctly, and we need to finish writing out the main function.  Then I'll give her code a once-over to see if there's any glaring holes we missed according to the teacher's rubric.

Session 3
----------
* I'll start off by asking her to explain where we left off yesterday, to make sure she understands it.
** She understood it well.

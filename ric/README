Ricardo is starting from scratch learning python, so I'll be keeping the lessons short and simple at first, then moving on to fun little exercises to teach new components.
Plan of teaching:
=First Session=
*Hello World
*Variables (put someone else's name into "Hello World", add numbers together)
*Getting input from the user (Prompt user for his name, put into "Hello world")
*Basic conditional (guess a number, get one chance to get it right)
*Modules (have random module choose the number for the user)
*For loop (give multiple guesses for someone to get it right)
*While loop (give infinite guesses for someone to get things right)
**Add in conditionals to give feedback to the guesser if they're high or low
*Project to bring it all together
**Create Rock Paper Scissors game
***User can choose to play a round, see their stats, or quit
***Stats will be how many times the player has won, how many times the computer has won, and how many times they tied
*Extra time: Talk about pseudo-random numbers
**As an example of why this matters, imagine trying to count even and odd numbers when the only numbers you can choose from are 1,2, and 3.
***Odd numbers would account for 66% of the numbers picked, even though it should be 50% in an ideal random number generator
**Have student try to figure out which hand sign his RPS program is biased to.

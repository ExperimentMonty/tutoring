Session 1
=========

Laura needed help with a C program Breadth-First Search implementation of
Dijkstra's algorithm.

Session 2
========

Laura needed help with a project that required her to implement a hash table
that used linear probing.  Initially she had sent me the wrong document, so I
spent the first hour explaining hash tables using linked lists to handle
collisions, and implementing a hash algorithm that used a bunch of bitshift
operations.  Then I discovered she had different instructions in front of her,
and we redid the hash function (second one was much easier).

We then went through the basics of creating the correct structures for the hash
table, and the basics of initializing the hash table.  We coded it up without
any error checking, and then we had to re-do part of it because we messed up the
function signature because I was just guessing what the function would look
like, and then we actually discovered what the function prototype would look
like as I looked through the project description to see what I should explain
high-level before I left.  We'll probably be meeting up on Thursday to see how
well she's done at implementing the other functions.
